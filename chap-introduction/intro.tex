\section{Context}
%\subsection{Overview on today transportation systems}
Since the mid-twentieth century, the greater accessibility to the private car in industrialized countries has significantly improved the people mobility.
In a lot of places, cars are still today the only transportation solution, especially in sparsely populated areas not or poorly served by public transport.
In addition, their ability to be used on-demand and perform door-to-door travels with a certain level of comfort make them very attractive and not easily substituted by other alternative transportation modes.
The revolution that car has bought in terms of independence and transportation flexibility has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies \cite{jakle_lots_2004}.

\medskip
While this new mode of transportation greatly helped societies realize their aspiration for growth and prosperity, it also resulted in serious negative externalities.
Today, most of the major urban agglomeration suffer from congestion, lack of parking spaces, air and noise pollution.
\cite{maibach_handbook_2007} also identified several external costs (social, human, environmental, etc.) that can be attributed to car usage.
The list includes accidents, water and soil pollution, climate change and energy dependency.
As a consequence, worldwide public authorities placed the automotive in the heart of ecological concerns and over the last few years a lot of efforts are made to find alternative solutions \cite{mitchell_reinventing_2010}.
In the last decades, sharing has become a practical answer to many global socio-economic issues.
Although individual property is still predominant in our economic world, social organization has experienced that sharing information, goods or opinions can bring out sustainable answers.
Environmental consciousness for instance is consistent with the idea of sharing, not only because it is a new way of consumption, but also of its implications on objects (or services) design \cite{ciari_sharing_2012}.

\medskip
In the field of transportation, vehicle-sharing systems has emerged in the last twenty years as an innovative solution, dealing with both environmental and transportation issues.
Particularly implanted in dense urban areas, they are now recognized as an additional mobility supply and a transportation mode in itself.
Where traditional public transport, including buses, subways, trains and tramways fail at providing a great  flexibility in terms of covered area and time availability, vehicle-shared systems bring out significant advantages.
In 2007, the launch of V{\'e}lib' in Paris, France, disposed about $20,000$ self-service bikes over more than $1,000$ stations \cite{laporte_shared_2015}.
Its success has certainly asserted the idea and benefits of bicycle-sharing services around the world.
Today, more than $7,000$ systems involving over $800,000$ bicycles are currently operational.

Almost in the same time, numerous carsharing systems has been launched and their indisputable success, mainly in north America, Europe and Asia, suggests that they will continue to expand in the coming years.
Often praised and subsidized by public authorities (especially in Europe), carsharing provide the advantages of the automotive without the drawbacks of ownership.
Cars are available on-demand at defined locations, and rented for a short periods of time.
Since each vehicle is more active on road and spend less time parked, carsharing participate to promote a more efficient and sustainable car utilisation.
Recent advances in real-time Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) also reinforced the service attractiveness, providing better accessibility to manage vehicle reservations \cite{jorge_carsharing_2013}.


In the early 1990s, due to increasing attention on environmental concerns, political authorities began to push for more fuel-efficient and lower-emissions vehicles.
As a response, and driven by promising advances in batteries and energy management, automakers initiated the development of electric vehicles.
Since 2008, electric cars are available to the public and as of 2015, the Renault-Nissan Alliance announced the milestone of $300,000$ units sold worldwide.
Include electric cars in their global fleet of vehicles came early in the history of carsharing.
As reliable experimental fields, carsharing systems with electric cars actually helped popularizing the concept of plug-in electric vehicles while reinforcing their positive impact on the environment.

\medskip
Fundamentally, carsharing systems embody a new paradigm with regard to car usage.
Indeed, the economical model depends on the time and the distance the user travelled.
Its operational principles modify drastically the way people perceive and utilize the vehicle.
The standard user behaviour evolves from an property-based usage (\ie using the vehicle because of owned it) to an utilization depending on real mobility needs.
This phenomenon partly explains why carsharing users drive less and for shorter period of time, helping to enhance traffic conditions.

\section{Motivations}

% \subsection{Industrial context}
All carmakers reflect on the evolution of their business and are considering to become active actors of the mobility. 
They do not want to be limited to the design, the sale, the manufacture or the repairs of vehicles.
The recent emergence of carsharing systems has raised a new potential business.
As a complement to the offer of public transport, deliver and operate carsharing fleets, is now a promising market.
To achieve these new objectives, car manufacturers have to elaborate methods and tools to assess the needs of a territory for this new mode of transport.
The methods and tools need to estimate demand, assist in the design of carsharing stations but also should provide economic arguments justifying the choice of this new mode of transport.
Moreover, primarily in large cities, the deployment of carsharing systems should move towards electric vehicles to take into account anti-pollution standards and even the prohibition of use of thermal motor vehicles.
The energy constraints, brought by electric cars must be considered by the methods and tools.
In addition, it will also be important to propose the operation methods of carsharing systems, taking into account their integration in the global system of multimodal transport.
